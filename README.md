The atmosphere is comfortable and informal.
Buster’s has done well in 2019 and we would like to know more about the factors that influence the sales at Buster’s Brewhaus so that they can continue to expand.  We have taken demographic data from people who live close to each location in an attempt to find a link between certain demographics and increased sales.  This information would give us an idea about which locations would be most profitable for future development, and who the target audience is for marketing.
The purpose of this paper is to build and estimate the best fitting models to explain sales at Buster’s given the potential regressors found during pre-model analysis.
